File System Vs Git

File System 

1. if i want to create a file in file system
i will use vim, touch, gedit etc commands along with the file name
eg: touch demo.txt
you will have owner, time, permission etc

suppose i remove demo.txt and even delete from recycle bin then i can't get it back


Repository

to make a file use "touch demo.txt"

and i use git init
now this demo.txt is not version controlled

now you can also see the author name, time, edit version of that file

this is called as commit hash

now if i delete the files from anywhere on the system then i can restore from anywhere

using the version control system
